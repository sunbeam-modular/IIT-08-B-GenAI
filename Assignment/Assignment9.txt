Q1:
• Create two tools using the @tool decorator: a CSV Question Answering tool and a Web Scraping tool.
• The CSV tool should upload a CSV file, show its schema, and answer user questions by converting them into SQL queries using pandasql.
• The Web Scraping tool should collect internship and batch information from the Sunbeam Institute website and answer related queries.
• Build a single intelligent agent that automatically selects and uses the correct tool based on the user’s question.
• Test the agent with relevant prompts, inspect message history to observe tool-calling behavior, maintain full chat history, and explain all responses in simple English.

2) Demonstrate the steps to create and switch to a new Git branch, make changes, commit them, and merge the branch into the main branch.
